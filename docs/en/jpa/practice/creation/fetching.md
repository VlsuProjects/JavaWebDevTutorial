# Fetching Strategies in Spring Boot with JPA: Understanding Lazy and Eager Loading

## Introduction

This guide explores the fetching strategies in a Spring Boot project with JPA (Java Persistence API). Specifically, we will delve into the concepts of Lazy and Eager loading and how they are applied in entity relationships.

## Goal

The goal of this guide is to provide a comprehensive understanding of fetching strategies in JPA. By the end of this guide, you will comprehend when to use Lazy and Eager loading and how to implement them in your application.

## Fetching Strategies

### Scenario

In our entity relationships, we have a One-to-Many relationship between the `Student` entity and the `Enrollment` entity. Similarly, there is a One-to-Many relationship between the `Course` entity and the `Enrollment` entity.

#### Student Entity

In the `Student` entity, we have a One-to-Many relationship with the `Enrollment` entity. Each student can have multiple enrollments.

To represent this relationship, we use the `@OneToMany` annotation with `mappedBy = "student"` in the `Student` entity. Here, we have a choice between Lazy and Eager loading strategies for fetching the associated enrollments.

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "student", fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<Enrollment> enrollments;
```

We opt for Eager loading (`FetchType.EAGER`) in this scenario. Since we typically expect to access all enrollments of a student together, Eager loading ensures that all enrollments are fetched immediately when loading the student.

#### Course Entity

Similarly, in the `Course` entity, we also have a One-to-Many relationship with the `Enrollment` entity. Each course can have multiple enrollments.

To represent this relationship, we use the `@OneToMany` annotation with `mappedBy = "course"` in the `Course` entity. Here, we have another choice between Lazy and Eager loading strategies for fetching the associated enrollments.

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "course", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<Enrollment> enrollments;
```

We opt for Lazy loading (`FetchType.LAZY`) in this scenario. Since we may not always need to access all enrollments of a course, Lazy loading ensures that enrollments are fetched only when explicitly requested.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided insights into the concepts of Lazy and Eager loading. By understanding the scenarios where each fetching strategy is appropriate and how to implement them in your entities, you are now equipped to optimize data fetching and improve the performance of your application.
